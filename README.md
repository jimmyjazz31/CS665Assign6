# CS665Assign6
### The refactorings that I have done on the original Assignment 2 are:  
-  extract method.
-  The next refactoring was Introduce parameter method and this was done on the Bank.java app and in doing this it added another class:  CreateAccountParameter.
-  The 3rd refactoring was extract interface and this was done on the main runnable app.
-  In account.java I then did a move method which simplified the code.  All the refactoring still allowed the 2nd assignment to run as expected.
